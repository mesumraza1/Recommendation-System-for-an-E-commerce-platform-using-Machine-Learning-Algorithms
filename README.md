# ðŸ§  Recommendation System using Machine Learning with Python

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a recommendation system using Machine Learning algorithms in Python. Recommendation systems are essential in a variety of applications like e-commerce (product recommendations), streaming platforms (movie/music recommendations), social media (friend suggestions), and more.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Content-based filtering
- Collaborative filtering
- Similarity measures (Cosine, Pearson)
- Model evaluation and performance comparison
- Interactive recommendations based on user input


## ðŸ“Š Algorithms Used

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends items similar to those liked by the user based on item features.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items based on similar users' preferences.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Used to measure the similarity between vectors of item features or user ratings.
- **Matrix Factorization (Optional)**: For dimensionality reduction in collaborative filtering.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recommendation-system-ml.git
   cd recommendation-system-ml
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook or script:
   - Open Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Or run via script:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

## ðŸ§ª Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy
- jupyter

> Install them all with:  
> `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Precision@K
- Recall@K

## ðŸ“Œ Usage

You can input your preferences or user ID and receive a list of top recommendations. The model automatically detects similar items or users and returns results accordingly.

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Improvements

- Add hybrid recommendation system (combine content + collaborative)
- Integrate with a web interface using Flask or Streamlit
- Deploy on cloud (e.g., Heroku, AWS)
- Real-time user feedback loop
